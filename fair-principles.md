# FAIR principles

## FAIR\_Bioinfo objective

We propose to use the FAIR data principles to make an analysis protocol reproducible and always obtain the same results from the same data. 

## FAIR data

FAIR data are data which meet standards of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability \([Wilkinson et al. , Nature, 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)\). In summary :

* **Findable** : the data must be easy to find by everyone
* **Accessible** : easily recoverable
* **Interoperable** : content in standard format with metadata
* **Reusable** : clear description and standard format for easy data use

## How to use the FAIR data principles?

To make scripts and protocols in Bioinformatics more reproducible, we base our approach on the principles of FAIR. Thus, we do not follow the following principles :

* **Findable** 
  * Tools used = references in their field
  * Easy to find analysis protocol \(Github pages\)
* **Accessible** 
  * Available resources \(Github, dockerhub\)
  * Open source tools \(conda\)
* **Interoperable** 
  * Cooperation of tools \(snakemake, docker\) both locally and on servers \(cloud or cluster\)
* **Reusable**
  * Protocol that can be simply replayed \(snakemake\) in the same way \(Rmarkdown\) in a virtual environment \(docker\)

## Our creed : So FAIR !

In the end, our creed is SO FAIR. From raw FAIR data, we will apply scripts and protocols that follow the FAIR\_Bioinfo principles. The objective is to obtain FAIR-processed data.
